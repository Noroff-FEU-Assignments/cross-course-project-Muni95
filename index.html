    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would advise my potential client to secure their website from web security attacks with the following web security best practices:

        1) Sanitization of data by using a third-party solution like Node.js or doing it manually. This is to ensure that the data accepted by the client`s website is in the correct format.
        2) Secure authorization and authentication by using open-standard authorization protocols or frameworks such as OneLogin. This type of authorization is difficult to crack.
        3) Making sure to research and ensure that the third-party application the client uses is trusted and tested, by among others, checking how many downloads the application gets per week.
        4) Using CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions and Jenkins to catch oversights from developers and thus maintain the reliability of code changes.
        5) Being aware of which network to connect to and where to host the website, since data can be compromised via hosting platforms.
        6) Implementation of automatic user timeout to protect users who have left their credentials hanging in the browser for a long time.]</p>
